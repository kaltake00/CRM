# Project Management system
This is my customers/projects management system in which I have implemented modular tabs such as users, clients, tasks, project and leads. The project is not over yet. I am working on the project with the goal of finishing my work at the IT academy.

The project is being done in the PYQT python library, which includes many other libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, fenret encryption and others ...

The project was done in order to demonstrate my skills with object-oriented programming and software development.
